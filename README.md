# Gleason Comparison Platform — v0.5.0

Offline-first bilingual geospatial comparison platform with three independent
model engines:

- **Gleason Historical** — source-grounded historical reconstruction with
  explicit evidence classifications.
- **AE Visualization** — independent north-polar Azimuthal Equidistant model.
- **WGS84 Reference** — modern geodetic reference globe/2D fallback with
  authoritative backend reference calculations.

> **Current development status — 2026-09-20**
>
> Phase 5 is **ACCEPTED BY OWNER** at **v0.5.0** after closure of P5.1–P5.9.
> Phase 6 was explicitly started by the owner on 2026-09-20. **P6.1 Measurement
> Semantics Contract is CLOSED** after CI #519/#520/#529 SUCCESS and **5/5 manual
> checks PASS — REPORTED BY OWNER**. PR #15 is merged and post-merge CI #530
> succeeded. **P6.2 Ordered Route State is CLOSED** after CI #532/#546 and
> **6/6 manual checks PASS — REPORTED BY OWNER**, plus the direct-map refinement
> retest PASS. Accepted phase remains
> **5** and accepted application version remains **v0.5.0** until a
> separate Phase 6 acceptance decision.

Phase 5 as a whole is **ACCEPTED BY OWNER**. Historical reports retain the status
that was true when each report was written; current status is defined by this
README, `docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF_CURRENT.md`, and
`docs/PHASE_5_PLAN.md`.

## Implemented Phase 5 capabilities

- One typed canonical WGS84 geographic selection shared by all three model
  views; free-point picks never inherit stale place identity.
- Independent adapters with explicit model/version/domain/unit/provenance.
- Search/pick/marker synchronization without pixel-coordinate coupling.
- Model Laboratory explaining the same geographic point in all three systems.
- Comparability rules that reject unlike meanings/spaces/scales instead of
  forcing normalization.
- Independent cameras and navigation controls on Gleason, AE and WGS84:
  zoom, wheel/pinch support, zoom-to-area, rotation/view-direction where
  meaningful, reset, fit-full and focus-selected.
- Homogeneous numeric differences only after a valid comparability decision;
  current cross-model pairs expose no fabricated numeric delta.
- Versioned future-service contracts for time/astronomy, shared layer
  synchronization and routes; all are explicitly **Unavailable** until their
  planned phases.

### P5.8 current scope

P5.8 has implemented and closed schema-versioned IndexedDB persistence for the canonical
Phase 5 geographic selection. Saved place identity is restored only when an
unchanged matching record exists in installed offline packs; otherwise only the
valid coordinate is restored, without inventing place provenance.

P5.8 does not persist routes, experiments, astronomy state or shared future
service state.

P5.8 acceptance: owner-reported PASS after CI #439/#442 SUCCESS.

### P5.9 clean integration note

P5.8 PR #11 is now merged into `main` at
`7d490d6bf207a1d919cb01f5f99ac8a7275f0fd4`. P5.9 continues on the clean
branch `feat/phase5-p5-9-acceptance-clean`.

P5.9 is CLOSED after clean-head CI #487 SUCCESS and all ten owner manual
regression checks were reported PASS. The owner then explicitly accepted Phase 5
as a whole on 2026-09-20. Accepted application version is now **0.5.0**. A
superseded PR #12 contains unverified acceptance/version claims and must not be
merged.

### P5.9 closure

P5.9 is the final Phase 5 regression package and is now **CLOSED**. It added no
new model engine. The owner reported PASS on all ten manual checks covering
browser/offline/bilingual/mobile behavior, navigation independence, Model
Laboratory semantics, persistence, WebGL fallback and Phase 6 boundaries.

The machine-readable evidence remains in
`docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE_PACKAGE.json`, and the explicit whole-phase owner
decision is recorded in `docs/PHASE_5_ACCEPTANCE.md`.

## Phase 6 current scope

P6.1 provides the closed measurement-semantics contract. P6.2 adds transient
ordered geographic route-point state with explicit point/segment identity and
editing controls. The route measurement/provider service remains fail-closed.

## Explicitly not implemented yet

- Route drawing/provider paths and numeric ruler/distance/perimeter/area calculations (P6.3+).
- Road/flight routing without a dedicated data provider.
- Astronomy/time engine or timeline.
- Shared cross-model layer-state service.
- Automatic conversion of Gleason `normalized-radius` to metres/kilometres.
- Verified distributable standalone historical Gleason scan/control points.

## Source and data status

Production source data remain locked; this documentation synchronization does
not replace or mutate them.

| Source | Locked version / revision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Gleason primary source | `gleason-1893-upload-v1`, 432 PDF pages, SHA-256 `03e429285376c7fcd21659116f43a8da7d6e363169e7c7841c9b31518effbe60` | Historical source record |
| Natural Earth | 5.1.2, commit `f1890d9f152c896d250a77557a5751a93d494776` | Locked |
| OurAirports | 2026-09-17, commit `634f91708ba8830b75e4f7905afce3cd4e49144e` | Locked |

Current locked catalog expectations: **177 countries · 243 cities · 16 seas ·
7 oceans · 12 rivers · 632 mountains · 86,089 airports**.

Authoritative manifests:

- `data/sources/gleason-book.yaml`
- `data/sources/phase3-source-lock.json`
- `data/sources/phase3-place-sources.yaml`

No fabricated coordinates, scan control points or undocumented historical scale
conversion are allowed.

## Architecture rules

- Shared state is **geographic**, never screen pixels.
- Gleason Historical, AE Visualization and WGS84 Reference stay numerically
  independent.
- Do not normalize outputs merely to make models agree.
- Keep `SOURCE_TEXT`, `SOURCE_CLAIM`, `COMPUTED_RESULT` and
  `REFERENCE_RESULT` distinct.
- Missing input/data stays missing; do not silently invent height, identity,
  scale or provenance.
- Backend WGS84 reference calculations remain the numerical acceptance
  authority; client-side implementations are independently parity-tested.

## Run the current main branch

### Git / Docker

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Do **not** run `docker compose down -v` unless you intentionally want to erase
local Docker volumes/data.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install uv==0.12.15
uv sync --locked --extra dev
uv run --locked --extra dev pytest -q
uv run --locked uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm run test:core
npm run test:pwa
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

## Production data workflow

A normal Docker startup does not automatically replace/import the complete
locked production datasets.

```bash
python scripts/fetch_phase3_sources.py --output-dir .phase3-data
```

On Windows, when the Python launcher is the reliable interpreter:

```bash
py -3 scripts/fetch_phase3_sources.py --output-dir .phase3-data
```

Use the existing update/import scripts documented in Phase 3 and the Arabic city
correction report. Never delete Docker volumes merely to refresh source data.

## Documentation map

Current source-of-truth documents:

- `docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF_CURRENT.md` — canonical continuity handoff.
- `docs/ROADMAP_CURRENT.md` — approved phases 0–22 and boundaries.
- `docs/PHASE_5_PLAN.md` — ordered Phase 5 slice contracts/status.
- `docs/PHASE_5_P5_9_REPORT.md` — latest closed Phase 5 slice.
- `docs/PHASE_6_PLAN.md` — ordered Phase 6 slices and current P6.2 boundary.
- `docs/NAVIGATION_MEASUREMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md` — navigation/measurement requirements.
- `docs/GITHUB_SYNC_AUDIT_2026-09-19.md` — GitHub/documentation/data audit.
- `docs/POST_PR13_MERGE_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-20.md` — post-merge documentation reconciliation.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — chronological implementation/acceptance history.

Historical phase reports under `docs/` are evidence artifacts and are
intentionally not rewritten to pretend they were authored at the current state.

## Historical scan limitation

The affine/georeferencing engine is implemented, but no verified distributable
standalone historical map scan is embedded and `control_points` remains empty.
Do not fabricate control points or claim that the source printed the modern
analytic reconstruction used by the software.

## Release / merge boundary

PR #13 was separately authorized and has been **merged into `main`** at
`913ec67c195ac5971e0f63d9acfe94dba8de60bf`. The accepted PR head passed
Release Acceptance Gates **#514**, and the resulting `main` merge commit passed
Release Acceptance Gates **#515**.

No tag or GitHub Release exists and deployment remains a separate authorization.
The owner has started Phase 6; P6.1 is closed and P6.2 is the active slice.
